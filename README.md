# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I used APIs, JSON, and other tools to help Jack build a PlanMyTrip App. Since his company is receiving lots of business, he believes an App will help travelers find their ideal vacation spot.

## Summary
The PlanMyTrip App allows travelers to do the following:

1. Select weather preferences, which are then used to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels.

2. Choose four cities from the list of travel destinations, which then creates a travel itinerary.

3. Access the travel itinerary, along with the newly created marker layer map, which will be used for their trip.

## Results
The project was a success and Jack believes travelers will have a much better experience using the App to plan their dream trip.
